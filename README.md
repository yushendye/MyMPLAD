<h2> Automatic Gate Monitoring Sysyem </h2>

<p>
This project was assigned to me during my training cum internship at IBM. During this project I was responsible
              for creating user interface and making a fully working application. MPLAD is initiative by Indian Government for enabling the citizens to communicate the 
              dificulties that they are facing directly to the members of parliament. During this project I learned various components of android framework and various 
              ways of designing attractive user interface. I was working on SQLite database for backend of this application. I also worked on JSON parser while working
              on this project.
